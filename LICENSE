License Grant: Permission is granted, without charge, to any entity obtaining this software and associated files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, adhering to the following conditions:

1. Commercial Use
   - Utilizing the Software or its derivatives for revenue-generating or monetized activities is restricted unless a "Meaningful Contribution" has been made to the Software. "Monetized use" includes selling, integrating into products or services sold, or using the Software for any form of revenue generation.
  
2. Meaningful Contribution Defined
   Contributions qualify as "Meaningful" if they meet any of the following criteria:

   - 2(a) Address a widely experienced issue faced by at least 5 other users, provided through:
     - i. Comprehensive research and documentation.
     - ii. A pull request that offers a solution.
   
   - 2(b) Introduce a feature that satisfies any of:
     - i. Is novel and has not been previously rejected by the Software maintainer.
     - ii. Has been requested by other users or contributors.
     - iii. Has been a pending request for 6 months or longer.
   
   - 2(c) Report an issue that is:
     - i. Critical, essential to the functioning of the Software, or represents a major security threat.
   
   - 2(d) Submit a pull request introducing significant functionality or enhancements, as acknowledged by the Software maintainer as substantial.
   
   - 2(e) Provision essential resources or materials beneficial for the Software with the clear intent to support it. This must be explicitly acknowledged and accepted by the maintainer.
   
   - 2(f) Contribute by reporting verified bugs, subject to the following:
     - i. One bug report if the contributor is an individual or part of an entity with fewer than 10 people.
     - ii. Ten verified bug reports if the contributor is part of an entity with 10 or more people.
     - iii. For employees, contributions must be made explicitly on behalf of, and during compensated time by, their employer.
     - iv. Bugs must be previously unreported, relevant to core functionality, non-trivial, and confirmed by the Software maintainer as actual bugs.
   
   - 2(g) Any other significant contribution as reasonably deemed appropriate by the maintainer.

Note: All contributions should be submitted in the specified Software repository or a related project repository if allowed (see Section 3).

3. Contribution Recognition
   - Contributions must be made in the Software's specified repository. If "Number of Related Projects" is specified as greater than 0, contributions can be directed to these specified forks or derivatives.
   - For repositories with "Number of Related Projects" set to 0 or left blank, "the Software" pertains solely to the original project, and contributions should be made to the original repository.

4. Rights Extension and Cross-Project Contributions
   - The Software owner may extend a "Meaningful Contribution" credit across multiple projects under their ownership if each project uses this license. Explicit contributor consent is required for contributions to apply across projects. This ensures transparency and maintains contributor control over their "Meaningful Contribution" status.

5. Revocation of Contribution Status
   - Once a contribution is recognized as "Meaningful," this status cannot be revoked except in the following cases:
     - i. Legally mandated circumstances, such as court directives.
     - ii. Violations of the terms of this license by the contributor.
     - iii. Cases of misconduct or integrity issues by the contributor that would reasonably justify revocation.
   - In cases of revocation, the contributor may seek review as outlined in Section 7 below.

6. Redistribution
   - Any redistribution of the Software must include:
     - i. This license and all terms specified here.
     - ii. The original disclaimer:
       "THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS,' WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY SORT, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. HOLDERS OF COPYRIGHT, AUTHORS, OR MAINTAINERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITIES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR ITS USAGE."
     - iii. A link to the Original Repository, and if applicable, any listed Related Projects as per Section 3.
   - This redistribution requirement applies consistently, regardless of "Related Projects" status.

7. Review and Appeals Process
   - Contributors seeking confirmation of their "Meaningful Contribution" status may request an official review from the Software maintainer. In cases of dispute or revocation, contributors may seek a review by a panel including a maintainer and a designated contributor advocate (if available).
   - Acknowledged contributions should be documented in the repository as confirmation.

8. Dual Licensing Compatibility
   - To enhance compatibility with other open-source licenses, this Software may be dual-licensed under [Specify Additional License, e.g., MIT or GPL] for non-commercial use cases, allowing for integration into projects governed by open-source licenses with specific terms (such as the GPL).
   - For commercial use, CPMCL terms apply exclusively unless specific exceptions are documented in the Softwareâ€™s repository.

9. Jurisdiction
   - Any disputes arising under this license shall be governed by the laws of [Specify Jurisdiction, e.g., California, United States] and resolved in its courts unless another jurisdiction is explicitly agreed upon.
