# README for Commercially Permissive Meaningful Contribution License (CPMCL)

---

**Public Domain Declaration:** This license, CPMCL Version 2.3, is declared to be in the public domain. This means anyone can use, modify, or distribute it without seeking permission or owing any attributions.

---

**TL;DR:**  
The CPMCL license lets you use, modify, and share the software freely. However, if you plan to use it for commercial purposes (e.g., in a paid product or service), you must make a "Meaningful Contribution" to the project. Contributing meaningfully could mean fixing widely reported issues, adding valuable features, reporting major bugs, or supplying critical resources. These contributions ensure that the project remains open and beneficial for all.

**Plain English Breakdown:**

1. **About the Software:**
   - This license details what you're allowed to do with the software and the responsibilities that come with using it commercially.

2. **What Can You Do?**
   - You can use, modify, share, and even sell or distribute the software freely for personal or non-commercial purposes. Commercial use, however, requires a contribution to the project.

3. **There’s a Catch for Commercial Use:**
   - If you want to make money with this software (directly, like selling it, or indirectly, such as integrating it into a paid service), you need to "give back" by contributing to the project in a meaningful way.

4. **What Counts as a "Meaningful Contribution"?**
   - Here are some examples of what qualifies:
     - **Solving an Issue**: Fixing a common problem experienced by multiple users, and sharing the fix.
     - **Adding Requested Features**: Implementing features that the community or project maintainers have requested or have been pending for a long time.
     - **Reporting Critical Bugs**: Identifying serious issues that affect the software’s functionality or security.
     - **Offering Significant Enhancements**: Submitting pull requests that introduce major improvements, which the project maintainers deem valuable.
     - **Providing Essential Resources**: Supplying critical tools or materials that help advance the project, with the maintainer's explicit consent.
     - **Other Contributions**: Any other action that the maintainer considers impactful and beneficial for the project.

5. **Where to Make Contributions?**
   - Contributions should be made directly to the original project’s repository. If the software is derived from a fork, check if there are any related projects (noted in the license) where contributions can also be made. The goal is to ensure contributions benefit the core project or closely related derivatives.

6. **Redistributing the Software?**
   - You’re free to redistribute the software, as long as you include this license, the disclaimer, and a link back to the original repository and any specified related projects. This keeps subsequent users informed of the licensing terms.

7. **Dual Licensing Option:**
   - For compatibility with open-source projects under other licenses, the software may also be available under an additional license (e.g., MIT or GPL) for non-commercial use. Commercial use, however, must adhere to CPMCL terms unless otherwise specified by the maintainer.

8. **Maintainer Rights and Revocation Conditions:**
   - While "Meaningful Contributions" generally can’t be revoked, maintainers may withdraw this status in specific cases, such as:
     - Violations of license terms
     - Legally mandated scenarios (e.g., court orders)
     - Cases of contributor misconduct that impact the project
   - Contributors have the right to request a review of any revocation decision.

9. **Keep in Mind:**
   - This software is provided "as is" without any warranties. The authors or maintainers are not liable if something goes wrong when using the software.
