---

**Public Domain Declaration:** This license, CPMCL Version 2.1, is declared to be in the public domain. This means anyone can use, modify, or distribute it without seeking permission or owing any attributions.

**TL;DR:** 
This license lets you use, modify, and distribute the software however you like. But if you want to use it for business or to make money, you need to give back meaningfully to the original project or its close versions. "Meaningful" can mean fixing issues many people face, adding requested features, reporting big problems, or even providing vital tools or resources. Read on for the details.

**Plain English Breakdown:**

1. **About the Software:**
   - This software comes with a license (this document). It details what you're allowed and not allowed to do with the software.

2. **What Can You Do?**
   - Use, change, share, and even distribute or sell the software. No restrictions.

3. **There's a Catch, Though:**
   - Plan to earn money from it? Either directly (like selling it) or indirectly (such as within a paid service)? You must contribute to the project in a significant manner.

4. **What's a "Significant" Contribution?**
   - Solving an issue that's bothering a number of users.
   - Adding a feature that's been heavily requested.
   - Identifying critical flaws or issues.
   - Offering your modifications (a pull request) that brings considerable value.
   - Supplying essential resources or tools beneficial for the project's progress.
   - Or any action that the project's maintainer deems impactful.

5. **Where Should You Make These Contributions?**
   - It's best to contribute directly to the source where you obtained the software. If you've acquired it from a derivative far from the original, there might be specific intermediaries you need to consider. This is determined by a number the distributor might indicate.

6. **Want to Redistribute the Software?**
   - Feel free! Just make sure to include this license as well so subsequent users are informed of the rules.

7. **Always Keep in Mind:**
   - The software comes without any promises. It's provided "as is". If things don't pan out as anticipated, the authors or maintainers of the software aren't liable.
